// EVENT POOL, spanning 2015–2025
// Grouped into 6 eras. Each week draws 1 from each of the
// first 5 eras, and 2 from Era F (2025) = 7 total.
//
// TO ADD AN EVENT: append to the right era. Done.
//
// ⚠️  TITLE RULES, enforced forever:
//   • MAX 50 characters per title (fits 2 lines on mobile)
//   • NO em dashes (they are stripped automatically at serve time)
//   • Be punchy. Cut every word that is not essential.
//   • Mix: policy events, gaffes, scandals and personal moments.
//   • Test: count the chars before you commit.
